### Access to AWS Instances

We provide exercises for each module in AWS instances. You will be given a username and password,
along with the IP address of the instance. You can access the instance via ssh as follows:

```
ssh [USERNAME]@[IP ADDRESS]
```

### Directory Structure

The directory structure in your home directory will look like this:

```
/home/user1/
   |---Module-TOOL1
      |---exercise-1
      |---exercise-2
      |---exercise-3
   |---Module-TOOL2
      |---exercise-1
      |---exercise-2
      |---exercise-3
   ...
```

Each module directory contains directories for each exercise. Please run the exercises in each of them as indicated
by the speaker.
